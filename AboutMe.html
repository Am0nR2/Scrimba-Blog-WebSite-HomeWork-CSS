            <p class="home-blog-text">Welcome to my journal blog website, after several weeks of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path,
                 I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects
                  and meet like-minded peers. (I could do a better web-site but this is what they wanted)...</p>

        <h3 class="home-blog-subtitle">How I stay committed to learning</h3>
        <p class="home-blog-text">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
            I used to spend hours and hours learning, 
            then try to create simple projects using 
            what I learned or work new techniques 
            into existing projects. While that was fun, 
            I felt like it would be helpful to share what 
            I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>

        <h3 class="home-blog-subtitle">How I got started</h3>
        <p class="home-blog-text">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. 
            I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, 
            I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned 
            but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
            That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting 
            my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
